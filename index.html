                        The bookshelves are piled to the max 
                        with many unread books or books that
                        haven't been read in a long while. The
                        To-Read List continues to grow faster and
                        faster, but never shorter and shorter.
                        Whether this continuously growing collection
                        of books came from gifts, personal shopping,
                        or others, there are more untouched books
                        than read books.

                        atmosphere, beautiful book covers, and intoxicating
                        smells from the in-store cafe makes you want to buy 
                        another book and join in with your fellow booklovers
                        in the happiest place on earth.  
                    
                        <i>Or</i>, the recommendations from <i>BookTok</i>, freinds
                        and family are just too inticing to ignore. You
                        just have to buy that new recommendation now, even
                        though you have a few books you promised yourself
                        you'd read before making another purchase.
                        <i>Or</i>, you bought one book from the series, you
                        might as well buy the whole set!
