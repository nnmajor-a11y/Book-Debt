                <p>
                    The bookshelves are piled to the max
                    with many unread books or books that
                    haven't been read in a long while. The
                    To-Read List continues to grow faster and
                    faster, but never shorter and shorter.
                    Whether this continuously growing collection
                    of books came from gifts, personal shoping,
                    or others, there are more untouched books
                    than read books.
                    <i>But you can't help yourself!</i>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <i>Weither</i> you walk into the bookstore, the tranquil
                    atmosphere, beautiful book covers, and intoxicating
                    smells from the in-store cafe makes you want to buy
                    another book and join in with your fellow booklovers
                    in the happiest place on earth.

                    <i>Or</i>, the recommendations from <i>BookTok</i>, freinds
                    and family are just too inticing to ignore. You
                    just have to buy that new recommendation now, even
                    though you have a few books you promised yourself
                    you'd read before making another purchase.
                    <i>Or</i>, you bought one book from the series, you
                    might as well buy the whole set!
