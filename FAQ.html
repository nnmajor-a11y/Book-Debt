                            Not at all! A Book Debt is designed
                            to get the most out of all the books a
                            bookworm buys and owns, including
                            comic books and manga. A general rule of thumb
                            when it comes to graphic novels and
                            manga is this:
                            <br>
                            <i><Span class="section-indent"> One</Span> comic or
                                manga volume of a series or collection is a
                                <b>fraction</b> of that series's entirety.
                            </i>
                            <br>
                            <span class="section-indent">For</span> example,
                            let's say you bought a two-part comic series. Each
                            comic is valued at 0.5 debt & credit, unlike a chapter book's full
                            credit & debt. This is to encourage the graphic novel
                            readers to appreciate their comics through multiple reads.
                            After all, reading a comic book is usually faster and
                            less demanding. Following this rule encourages
                            Book Debt users to reread their comics and appreciate
                            the detailed artworks poured into each panel!

                            <br>
                            For example, if you have owned books you

                            record these books in your <i>Book Debt</i>.
                            <br>
                            If you own books that weren't obtained through
                            purchase, or you owned books before starting a
                            <i>Book Debt</i>, but you don't want to count it
                            as debt, then you would list the book without tallying
                            the <b>Bought</b> column. Doing it this way can help
                            bring down your accumulated debt and encourage you to
                            read any books you already have.
                            <br>
                            Both options are valid for encouraging you to read
                            your previously owned books. Considering your already-obtained 
                            books as part of your debt are also optional
                            to make you read the most out of them before buying
                            new books.
