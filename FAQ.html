                        Not at all! A Book Debt is designed
                        to get the most out of all books a
                        bookworm buys and owns, including
                        comic books and manga. A general rule of thumb
                        when it comes to graphic novels and
                        manga is this:
                        <br>
                        <i><Span class="section-indent"> One</Span> comic or
                            manga volume of a series or collection is a
                            <b>fraction</b> of that series's entirity.
                        </i>
                        <br>
                        <span class="section-indent">For</span> example,
                        let's say you bought a two-part comic series. Each
                        comic is valued 0.5 debt & credit, unlike a chapter book's full
                        credit & debt. This is to encourage graphic novel
                        readers to appreciate their comics through multiple reads.
                        After all, reading a comic book is usually faster and
                        less didication. Following this rule encourages
                        Book Debt users to reread their comics and appreciate
                        the detail artworks poured into each panel!

                        In short, No. In long, if you wish to
                        consider a book you already own as part
                        of your debt, then you can.
                        <br>
                        For example, if you have owned books you
                        wish to read first before buying anymore,
                        record these books in your <i>Book Debt</i>.
                        <br>
                        If you own books that weren't obtain through
                        purchase or you owned before starting a
                        <i>Book Debt</i> but you don't want to count it
                        as debt, then you list the book without tallying
                        the <b>Bought</b> column. Doing it this way can help
                        bring down your accumilated debt, and encourage you to
                        read any books you already have.
                        <br>
                        Both options are valid for encouraging you to read
                        you previously owned books. Considering your already
                        obtained books as part of your debt is also optional
                        to make your read the most out of them before buying
                        new books.
